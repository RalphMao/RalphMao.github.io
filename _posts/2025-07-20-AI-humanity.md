title: "Beyond AI Taking Jobs: When Economy Stops Needing Human Consumers"

When people consider AI’s threats, one of the major fears is unemployment. This is not incorrect, but it fails to distinguish AI from past technology advances, such as mechanized textile production replacing hand-weavers and ATM replacing bank tellers. AI revolution could have completely different impacts as previous industrial revolutions. Let's begin with the role of the consumer in the current economy.

## Why human consumers are important (so far)

Modern economic theories emphasize consumption. The GDP of an economy is calculated as household consumption + investment + government spending + net export. If we look at the economy on a global scale, net exports sum up to zero.
Investment and government spending, so far as we have seen in history, cannot drive economic growth forever. There was once a period in the US, in the Soviet Union and most recently in China, when investment and government spending drove tremendous economic growth. But none of them last forever. One of them is still going through a painful transition to a consumer economy.

History creates the impression that consumers (and of course, human consumers) will always be important. Based on past experiences, if AI takes over the producer role, creates tremendous unemployment and causes household consumption to fall, the whole economy will suffer. Therefore, corporations should be motivated to prevent this from happening, just as Walter Reuther said to Henry Ford – “[Robots do not buy cars](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/11/16/robots-buy-cars/)”.

However, the AI revolution could be different from past revolutions. To explain it, here comes the first claim of this article:

**From first principles, human consumption is not the must-have part of the economy.**

In the past, why did over-production and over-investment lead to economic crisis? The standard answer is that consumption failed to catch up. However, this is not the first-principled answer. Say if the consumption is weak, why don’t companies invest more, produce more, and sell to each other? The first-principled answer is that investment stops once it no longer generates financial returns. In addition, if productivity keeps increasing and drives inflation down, the central bank can increases corresponding money supply. So far this never happens in history, because the loop is broken somewhere.

My explanation is that consumption is essential because human is the driving factor of productivity, i.e., the productivity of productivity. For example, when cars were invented and produced at scale, they did not directly improve the productivity of other sectors, but rather did it indirectly by empowering humans – increasing mobility and freeing up more time. Without humans in the loop, there is no other "amplifiers" to keep economic circulation. If over-investment disrupts the labor market and causes humans to suffer, this productivity growth cannot be sustained. 

This is the first and by far the most fundamental economic flywheel over past centuries – **technology frees up more human brains from tedious work, and the freed-up human brains power more technology advances**. Government, academia and venture capital boost the efficiency of this flywheel, but the human remains as the ultimate driving force. And to keep this economic flywheel rolling, improving the lives and incentivizing the majority of human beings is the essential part of the economy. I found [a similar opinion from Hyung Won Chung](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15uQTN9M-aTBWHRcd69GBL57QsKV1EM5BhV8i3ihbSUc/edit?slide=id.g352b5d30508_0_0#slide=id.g352b5d30508_0_0), (published during the writing of this article), which uses the term “leverage” to describe the role of human in technology development. Although he believes AI will always play an augmenting role to humans.

It should be noted that the economic flywheel described above is different from the common term "economic circulation". In economic circulation, humans consume goods and produces goods. In the economic flywheel, humans consume the outcome of growth and produce more growth.

## The AI-consume AI-growth economy

Will human consumption always stay as important as it is now? In the first economic flywheel described above, technology augments humans and humans drive the productivity growth. After centuries of 

Here is the second claim of this article:

**AI consumption, which is currently classified as business investment or intermediate goods, has the potential to displace human consumption and sustain long-lasting economic growth.**

The unique capability of humans is to innovate and to broadcast the boost across many different fields. [AlphaGo's Move 37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol) was one of the very first moments to show AI can innovate. More recent progress in drug discovery, math proof and circuits engineering has gradually blurred the line between AI innovations and human innovations.
Moreover, Anthropic’s [Project Vend](https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-1) show the potential of taking over the business connections of traditional human roles.

Will we see a second flywheel in our lifetime? This time, AI is the fundamental driving force of the economy to grow the productivity and broadcast the growth across every field. This economic flywheel no longer relies on humans both as producers and consumers.

If the society does not handle this transition properly, we may witness a dystopian future – **Corporations not only don’t need to hire humans, but more importantly, corporations also don't need to sell to humans.** Big corporations with the aid of AI can form a positively growing economy by buying from and selling to each other, while the majority of the population gradually become irrelevant.

There might still be a few winners who benefit from this transition, like business owners and super smart AI researchers. However, this situation may also not last long:
- “Owning” the business through equities is a human consensus that requires both humans and consensus.
- Consistently producing super smart people requires a large-enough and educated population.

## Warning signs

Everything described so far sounds like a distant future when super intelligence finally comes true. However, this transition does not require AI to gain superior intelligence than human or being able to completely replace humans. It is more likely to be a gradual process as AI becomes overly more generalized and cheaper.

If we treat this AI revolution in the same way as past technology advance, and use traditional measures designed for over-production or over-speculation problems, we may soon see following signs of this AI-produce AI-consume economy:
- High unemployment rate and low inflation rate, but meanwhile strong GDP growth (which is against historical empirical rules like Okun's Law and Phillips Curve)
- Falling percentage of household consumption in GDP
- Growing revenues of large corporations, with a higher to-B incomes and a lower personnel costs

How to prevent such a transition? As the book [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind) points out, the fastest growing group outgrows others, even if the lives of individuals in that group become worse. If AI truly becomes more efficient and powerful, companies and countries who do not embrace it will fall behind the competitions. It is unlikely that this could be stopped even if majority of the population agree to stop it.

On the other hand, it is easier to list things that facilitates this transition:
- Tax and social security systems that incentivize capital investment instead of paying wages
- Lower interest rates and quantitative easing (QE) during high unemployment and low inflation rate
- Authoritarian society that have high tolerance of public discontent

I wish I was just being paranoid, and the society will automatically adapt to AI and harness it for the good of the people. If this is not true, I hope this article could be yet another alert of
