title: Psychology of Intelligence Analysis - Reading Notes

I always wondered how information analysis at goverment intelligence agency or business intelligence department works. A few weeks ago I saw someone recommended [Psychology of Intelligence Analysis](https://www.ialeia.org/docs/Psychology_of_Intelligence_Analysis.pdf) so I briefly read through it at the aid of LLM tools. It is an interesting but a little verbose book - should be well summarized in 2-3 articles in my opinion. 

Thanks to the power of LLM, without it I wouldn't be able to finish all the contents and delve into 3-4 sections that I found interesting or new to me. So here I am sharing my reading notes:

### Outline

The book is divided into 3 parts. Part I is supposed to be introductary but I found it actually has overlap with Part III. 

Part I - Mental Machinery:

1. Thinking processes: Intelligence analysis is fundamentally mental work, but analysts lack conscious awareness of their own thinking processes
2. Perception: We see what we expect to see; new information is often assimilated into existing beliefs rather than changing them
3. Memory: How information is organized in memory affects analytical ability; experts differ from novices in their mental schemas, not raw memory capacity

Part II - Analytical Tools:

4. Strategies for judgment: Most analysis follows a "satisficing" approach (accepting the first reasonable explanation) rather than systematically evaluating alternatives
5. Information limits: More information doesn't necessarily improve accuracy but does increase analyst confidence, often leading to overconfidence
6. Keeping an open mind: Mental ruts form easily; techniques like devil's advocacy, role-playing, and examining assumptions can help break them
7. Structuring problems: Complex problems should be decomposed and externalized (written down) to overcome working memory limitations
8. Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH): Heuer's signature method - systematically evaluating multiple explanations against evidence to identify which hypothesis has the least disconfirming evidence

Part III - Cognitive Biases:

9. Evidence evaluation: Vivid, concrete information has disproportionate impact; absence of evidence is often ignored; consistency is overvalued
10. Cause and effect: Tendency to see patterns where none exist; overestimate centralized planning; assume causes resemble effects
11. Probability estimation: Use of mental shortcuts (availability, anchoring) that can mislead; verbal probability expressions are ambiguous
12. Hindsight bias: After knowing outcomes, events seem more predictable than they actually were

### Takeaways

The key idea of this book, and what the author emphasizes right in the beginning: 

**Everyone thinks but not everyone is aware of their thinking process. "Intelligence analysts must understand themselves before they can understand others."**

There are common problems in one's perception, thinking process, and memory. The authors spend many chapters to point them out:

1. Tendency to perceive what they expect to perceive (not what the reality is, nor what they want to perceive)
2. Resists accepting randomness, try to summarize a pattern even from random data
3. Overestimates extent of centralized planning and rational coordination
4. Over-focuses on initial and most-recent evidence
5. Hindsight effect (Overestimates the predictability after seeing the outcome), which hinders people from learning from past

Another common problem is the **satisficing** approach in information analysis, which isn't wrong but the author suggest better methods exist. Satisficing is similar to the greedy algorithm used in computer science, which means:
1. Shape a hypothesis based on initial evidence
2. Look for evidence to support this hypothesis until it looks "good enough", and stop there. 

The better method is presented in **Chapter 8 - Analyssi of Competing Hypothesis (ACH)**. I should find a chance to try it out.


I find **Chapter 6 - keeping an open mind** to be most interesting, especially the practice suggestions for keeping open mind and stay creative. I think the same practice could possibly be used for business and research:

**Questioning Assumptions**
1. Sensitivity Analysis: Which assumptions drive your conclusions?
2. Alternative Models: Seek out people who disagree with you
3. Avoid Mirror-Imaging: Don't assume others think like you. Example: 1977 South African nuclear test - dismissing evidence because "they have no enemies to use it against"

**Seeing Different Perspectives**
1. Thinking Backwards: Start with unexpected outcome, work backwards to explain how it could happen
2. Crystal Ball: Imagine perfect source says your assumption is wrong - develop scenario explaining how
3. Role Playing: Actually act out other perspectives (not just imagine them)
4. Devil's Advocate: Assign someone to argue against prevailing view

In addition to individual practice guide, the author also states that organizational environment is important, i.e., personal creativity alone doesn't predict innovation - organizational climate is crucial. Several key signs in an innovative organization:
1. Responsibility for initiating new activities
2. Control over decisions
3. Security in professional role
4. Management that stays out of the way
5. Small project size
6. Diverse activities

### Thoughts

The practice suggested by the author largely resembles what I learned from middle-school science classes - find problems, propose hypothesis, do experiments/collect evidence, and run analysis. My science teacher told us doing experiments is the most important part. The author of this book prioritizes hypothesis and analysis over evidence for his job (given that he claims evidence is always abundant). I personally think finding the problem is the most critical part, but still a well-tested methodology to solving problems is important.

This book was published in 2007, way before the rise of AI and LLM. Somehow the terms, "perception", "memory", "attention span" of the mental "model" just happen to be the core focus of many LLM research that try to understand the behavior of ML "model".  Will intelligence research be applied to or even converge with AI research? 

**Notes about LLM chatbots**:
I tried Gemini, ChatGPT and Claude to summarize the book (with the provided pdf link), and:
1. Gemini pretended it read the book but it actually didn't even open the link, and the summary if largely off;
2. ChatGPT gave a very lazy overview (slightly more detailed than table of contents), and when asked to provide more details, it got denied opening the link again
3. Claude was the best that provided a short and meaningful summary first, and when asked to explain certain sections in details, it further provided quite solid in-depth review. The only weakness is that when context length became long, Claude's generation speed becomes noticeably slower.
