I am the co-founder and CTO of OmniML (acquired by NVIDIA in 2023). Currently I lead the technology development of ML inference optimization and TensorRT Model Optimizer at NVIDIA.

I graduated from Stanford University in 2021, advised by Prof. Bill Dally. Before coming to Stanford, I received my bachelor degrees in Electronic Engineering and Mathematics, both from Tsinghua University.
